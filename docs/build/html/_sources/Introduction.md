# Welcome to the HIL toolbox.

![](images/Toolkit_overview.png)


The main purspose of this is have a all in one toolkit for exoskeleton personalization.

---



Toolkit has following functionalities ( more added over time)
1. Data acquisition functions
2. Cost processing for the following cost functions
    - RMSSD ( ECG based cost function )
    - Metabolic cost
3. Modular Bayesian optimization to minimize or maximize the cost function
4. Exoskeleton communication using UDP

To setup the module please follow the [Install/setup](Setup.md)


#TODO
- Add information of the optimization.
- Add information about the cost acquisition.
- Add information the cost processing.
